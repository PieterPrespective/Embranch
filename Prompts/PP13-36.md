- IssueID = PP13-36
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- The current application has a critical architectural flaw - its designed around uni-directional data transfer from dolt to chroma - however actual use requires bi-directional data transfer - I've already asked Opus to update the design document - but now we'll need to update the codebase to match the new design; this includes reviewing all tests previously created for (still) relevance
- For context please read:
	- the updated architectural plan at - 'Documentation\tdd\Dolt_Interface_Implementation_Plan_V2.md'
		- Note : this is a very long document of 4970 lines - reading most of it will be be necassary to understand the full architectural context; please take chunked reading into account
	- a summary with details on what specifically changed compared to the original plan - 'Documentation\tdd\Dolt_Plan_Changelog_2025-12-13.md'
- Given the significant amount of context required for this assignment - please DO NOT actually write/change any code, but rather create a seperate document with specific instructions for follow-up runs - please create it at 'Documentation\tdd\CodeUpdatePlan_251215.md'
	- First deeply analyze the current sourcecode and hold it against the new 'Dolt_Interface_Implementation_Plan_V2.md' - if changes need to be made record the following
		- The Class and functions affected
		- The reason why it should be changed
		- Where in the document 'Documentation\tdd\Dolt_Interface_Implementation_Plan_V2.md' you identified this reason (for later reference, please include line numbers for easy reading later)
		- How this section should be changed (paraphrasing it should be sufficient for now - we'll detail it in a followup)
		- How this will affect test code and cases (if any)
		- Feel free to document more if you see fit
- At the end of this assignment make a brutally honest assesment - and include it in the document 'CodeUpdatePlan_251215.md' - given the current code base and the updated architecture document - will fixing the implementation in line with the new architecture allow for the following use cases (or will parts still be missing)
	- User A has a local repository and records teachings in the local chroma database
	- User A commits/pushes his teachings to Dolthub via the MCP server on branch main
	- User B pulls a clone from the teachings to his local repository - his ML uses these teachings via querying the chroma database 
	- User B updates the teachings based on own learnings
	- User B commits/pushes the updated teachings to Dolthub via the MCP server on branch B
	- User C pulls a clone from the teachings to his local repository - his ML uses these teachings via querying the chroma database 
	- User C updates the teachings based on own learnings
	- User C commits/pushes the updated teachings to Dolthub via the MCP server on branch C
	- User A merges the teachings from branches main, branch B and branch C on branch D - reviews their validity using a local clone and commits/pushes the combined teachings back to a new commit on branch main
	- Users B and C pull in the latest main and their chroma database is automatically updated with the new content
