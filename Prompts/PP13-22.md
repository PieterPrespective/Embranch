- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- Please see the 'Documentation' folder in this project for reference- it is to contain the documentation for this project. 
	- The documentation folder works using docfx 
	- Please properly setup code documentation for this project - please include both the DMMS and DMMSTesting project
		- Please specifically look at 'Documentation/docfx.json' - it contains the settings for this project - set it up in a way the code documentation will work - likely this will need changing to make use of the .csproj files - or .xml generation will need to be setup within the cs project
	- Please generate user documentation on setting up this MCP server within claude - note that you need only consider using the server in windows, and we only need to support direct use of the MCP server executable - output user documentation to the 'Documentation/userdocs' folder and properly set it up in the contained 'toc.yml' file
