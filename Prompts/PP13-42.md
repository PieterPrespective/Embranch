- IssueID = PP13-42
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- Currently - when calling the MCP tools linked to Dolt - they only return 'an error occurred' when the dolt executable is not setup as environment variable - when invoking one of these tools, please return a valid error/fail json reporting that the environment variable is missing
- The current application has a tool to list the dolt branches - but we do not yet have a tool to create, rename or delete one - please implement that -
	- It might be good to add an action parameter to the DoltBranchesTool.DoltBranches (e.g when 'action' is 'list' - it returns a list with branches, if 'action' is 'create' the filter string is used for branch name) - this way we need't create an additional tool (for rename, filter may need to be a JSON string)
		- If choosing this solution - properly update the Description attribute
	- For backend code implementation within IDoltCLI please see the page 'https://docs.dolthub.com/cli-reference/cli#dolt-branch'
	- Please implement an integration test to prove the functioning of the create branch tool
