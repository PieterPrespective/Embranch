- IssueID = PP13-60
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- In this stage of the assignment we'll only be investigating an issue, so no need to change code just yet - logging to chroma is allowed, but particularly use the chroma logs for researching the issue
- Currently the 'Remove Document' and 'Update Document' tools do not seem to fulfill their local functions - they do seem to work in the local chroma database, but do not actually update the dolt side - not when executing the tool, nor when committing the changes
- We've used the MCP server in the following test case:
	- 1 User Prompts - please clone the dolt repository 'pieter-prespective/NewTestDatabase' using dmms
		- Database succesfully clones, and sets up local chroma with files from latests main branch commit
		- we dumped the content of the local Dolt database to folder 'Examples\251223_1122\doltdump_1_AfterClone' for reference
	- 2 User Prompts - please remove the document with id 'someid3' from the collection
		- Document doesn't appear to be removed in dolt
		- see dump of local dolt database at this point in folder'251223_1122\doltdump_2_AfterDocRemove' for reference
	- 3 User Prompts - please update the document with id 'someid2' and change its content to 'User B added a document too, and changed
  it after'
		- Document doesn't appear to be updated in dolt
		- see dump of local dolt database at this point in folder '251223_1122\doltdump_3_AfterDocUpdate' for reference
	- 4 User Prompts - please commit the changes with message 'User B updated the collection main' 
		- Documents still dont appear to be updated in dolt
		- see dump of local dolt database at this point in folder '251223_1122\doltdump_4_AfterCommit' for reference 
- For the full flow - see the log resulting from the MCP Server: '251223_1122\vm-rag.log'
- Please deeply investigate why these tools do not result in local changes to dolt - and determine if they are properly detected as changes - then provide me with a systemic and durable fix suggestion - do not yet change any code
