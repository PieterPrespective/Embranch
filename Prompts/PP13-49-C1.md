- IssueID = PP13-49
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- This is an extension of the issue PP13-49, so please investigate the chroma logs when required
- This assignment addresses a critical bug in the collection discovery mechanism where GetTableNameFromResult method fails to extract table names from dynamic objects returned by SHOW TABLES queries, causing all table names to appear as 'unknown' and preventing proper collection discovery
- For context please read:
	- The original issue report in PP13-49.md which documented the collection discovery failure
	- The investigation findings showing that 6 tables are detected but all names return as 'unknown'
	- Log analysis in D:\Prespective\352327_DMMSReceive\DMMS\logs\vm-rag.log (lines 54-143) confirming the systematic failure pattern
- In this activity specifically focus on fixing the GetTableNameFromResult method in DoltCloneTool.cs to properly extract table names from dynamic SHOW TABLES query results
	- The root cause is dynamic object property access failure where all three extraction tiers fail:
		- Tier 1: Direct property access (Tables_in_dolt_repo, Tables_in_dolt_repo_10, Table)
		- Tier 2: Property name scanning for Tables_in_* pattern
		- Tier 3: First property fallback
	- Investigation requirements:
		- Deploy and analyze the enhanced diagnostic logging already implemented to understand the actual object structure
		- Determine the real database name being used (likely not 'dolt_repo' as assumed)
		- Examine the property names and types of dynamic objects returned by DoltCli.QueryAsync<dynamic>("SHOW TABLES")
		- Identify why dynamic property access patterns are failing
	- Implementation requirements:
		- Fix the GetTableNameFromResult method to handle the actual property structure returned by SHOW TABLES
		- Ensure robust table name extraction that works regardless of database naming
		- Add fallback mechanisms for different Dolt database configurations
		- Validate that the 'documents' table can be properly identified from the 6 detected tables
		- Test collection discovery end-to-end to ensure it finds 'main' collection instead of defaulting to 'default'
	- Testing requirements:
		- Verify that GetAvailableCollectionNamesAsync returns the expected collections after the fix
		- Confirm that sync creates 'main' collection with actual documents instead of empty 'default' collection
		- Test with different database names and structures to ensure robustness
		- Run existing integration tests to ensure no regression
- Expected outcome: Collection discovery mechanism works correctly, finding actual collections ('main' with 1 document) instead of creating empty 'default' collections during sync operations
