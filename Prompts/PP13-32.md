- IssueID = PP13-32
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- Please see the 'DMMSManualTesting' project - this is a cherry pick from a different project branch - within this branch we were under the impression authentication with dolthub was to be managed manually - which creates the risk of secret exposure. However, we later found that simply calling 'dolt login' already resolves the authentication automatically - outside of the LLM context
- This project now contains one manual test for validation of dolthub database functions - its however not fully functional
	- in step 1 the database information is retrieved - however - it does not take into account the actual formatting of the url (which has a repositories part) and thus outputs the user name as database etc. - the following is a log is the result of a previous run:
 ?? Step 1: Database Information
==============================

Please provide the DoltHub database information:

Enter the full DoltHub database URL (e.g., https://www.dolthub.com/username/database-name): https://www.dolthub.com/users/pieter-prespective/repositories

?? Parsed Database Information:
   Username: users
   Database: pieter-prespective
   Full URL: https://www.dolthub.com/users/pieter-prespective/repositories

?? Step 1: Verify the database information is correct
Press Enter to continue, or type 'abort' to stop the test...


???  Step 2: Test Environment Setup
==================================

Verifying Dolt installation...
? Dolt version: dolt version 1.78.5
Configuring Dolt user for commits...
Created test directory: C:\Users\piete\AppData\Local\Temp\DMMS_VMRAGTestSimple

?? Step 2: Environment setup complete
Press Enter to continue, or type 'abort' to stop the test...


?? Step 3: Clone Existing Database
=====================================

Cloning database from DoltHub...
Source: users/pieter-prespective
Target directory: C:\Users\piete\AppData\Local\Temp\DMMS_VMRAGTestSimple
This may take a moment depending on database size...
Running: dolt clone users/pieter-prespective
? Clone failed!
Error: error: failed to get remote db
cause: could not access dolt url 'https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/users/pieter-prespective': rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = permission denied

Output: cloning https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/users/pieter-prespective
