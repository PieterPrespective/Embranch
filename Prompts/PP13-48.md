- IssueID = PP13-48
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- Critical bug identified: DoltCloneTool sync to ChromaDB fails when cloning repositories with content, preventing users from accessing cloned documents via ChromaDB queries
- Investigation findings documented in previous conversation show that the FullSyncAsync method fails with "Collection default does not exist" exception during the delete operation
- For context please read:
	- Previous investigation conversation that identified the root cause of the sync failure
	- Log file analysis at D:\Prespective\352327_DMMSReceive\DMMS\logs\vm-rag.log (lines 104-156) showing the specific Python exception
	- DoltCloneTool.cs implementation (lines 598-614) where sync failures are caught but only logged as warnings
- The root cause:
	- FullSyncAsync attempts to delete a ChromaDB collection before recreating it
	- On fresh clones, ChromaDB is empty and has no collections to delete
	- The delete operation throws "Collection default does not exist" exception
	- This crashes the entire sync process, leaving ChromaDB empty despite successful Dolt clone
- Specific tasks to resolve:
	1. Fix SyncManagerV2.FullSyncAsync to handle non-existent collections gracefully
		- Add existence check before attempting to delete collections
		- OR catch the specific "collection does not exist" exception and continue
		- Ensure the method continues with collection creation and document sync
	2. Update error handling in DoltCloneTool to distinguish between sync failures and warnings
		- Sync failures should be reported as errors, not warnings
		- Users should be clearly informed if the clone succeeded but sync failed
	3. Add proper collection discovery from the cloned Dolt database
		- Instead of defaulting to "default" collection, detect actual collection names from the Dolt documents table
		- Handle cases where multiple collections exist in the Dolt database
	4. Ensure proper logging and user feedback
		- Log successful sync operations with document counts
		- Provide clear error messages when sync fails with specific remediation steps
		- Update the clone success message to reflect actual sync results
	5. Create or update tests to verify the fix
		- Test cloning repositories with existing content
		- Test sync behavior with non-existent vs existing ChromaDB collections
		- Verify that documents are properly accessible in ChromaDB after clone
- Expected outcome: Users can successfully clone Dolt repositories with content and immediately query the documents via ChromaDB without requiring additional manual sync operations
- Priority: HIGH - This is blocking basic clone functionality for repositories with content
