- IssueID = PP13-31
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- Please read the 'chroma-feat-design-planning-mcp' log on PP13-31; this is a continuation of that issue
- Please implement an test method within DMMSManualTesting that does the following
	- It is an option you can select when running the executable
	- It requests authentication for Dolthub via the DMMS.AuthHelper.exe - simular to how the final MCP server will do
	- It creates a new (public) database on that account named 'VMRAGTest'
	- It runs through all remote branch management and data CRUD  operations - but between every operation it requires user input (e.g. press enter) - this way I can manually validate the operations are properly executed on dolthub
	- For a full overview of dolt operations see the document 'Documentation/tdd/Dolt_Interface_Implementation_Plan.md' - specifically section 3.1
		- Note this is a large document (3055) lines, but all the information you need should be found in the first 500 lines
