- IssueID = PP13-59
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- Please deeply investigate the logging present in the 'ChromaAddDocumentsTool' - we've added logging to every user entry and exit point of the tool so we can better analyze how the tool flow progresses in use
- Please analyze if this logging implementation is safe to use (e.g. if for instance the logger isn't active in production, will it give null references?) - if deemed unsafe, please change the logging setup to function in a safe manner, but be sure to still clearly communicate to the user when a toolcall starts and exits, and with what data
- Please implement this logging structure within all tools found in the 'Tools' folder of the DMMS project
