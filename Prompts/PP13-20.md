- IssueID = PP13-20
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- Please setup a .net c# 9.0 Console App project usable from within visual studio 22 in the folder 'multidolt-mcp'
	- This project will contain an MCP server that will allow an CLI ML with mcp support to control multiple Dolt databases using direct terminal commands (i.e. not a SQL server)
	- In this assignment we will setup the c# project outline with MCP c# sdk
		- please refer to 'Examples\UMCPServer\UMCPServer' with 'Examples\UMCPServer\UMCPServer\Program.cs' in specific - this is the main program file for another implemented c# MCP server- please use it as reference for your new project structure
		- Please refer to 'Examples\csharp-sdk' and the files contained - this is the actual c# MCP SDK with readmes and samples for implementation
			- Please note that this folder is a recent clone, so use the source files from this folder, rather than those found in 'Examples\UMCPServer\UMCPServer' if you need to copy source
	- Setup a single tool 'GetServerVersion' - this tool should return values simular to'UMCPServer\UMCPServer\Tools\GetServerVersionTool.cs'
- Please also setup a seperate project for unit- and integration testing of this project (see BasePrompt) for guidelines
		- make sure to put this project in the folder 'multidolt-mcp-testing'
		- make sure both projects are accesible via a single .sln file - this .sln file should be put in this projects' root (i.e. the current folder)
