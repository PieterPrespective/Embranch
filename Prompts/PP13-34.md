- IssueID = PP13-34
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- please read the document 'Documentation/tdd/Dolt_Interface_Implementation_Plan.md'
		- Note this is a long document (3055 lines) - but reading it fully is important for your context - so please read it in segments - if thats too hard, let me know so I can segment it in readable chunks
- In this activity we'll be implementing and testing step 1.4 from Chapter 6 - this is basically the sync manager from section 5.2
	- Implement sufficient integration tests to validate sync state in both chroma and dolt
- At the end of this activity we should have a succeeding DMMSManualTesting test that 
	- This will be a manual testing test since it requires real dolthub login information
	- Setup chroma database with content - preferably use the pre-filled out-of-date database used in 'OutOfDateDatabaseMigrationTests'
	- Create a new dolt database and sync it with the input database
	- Create a new database on dolthub, and commit the content of the input database to it
	- Create a new output dolt and chroma database and checkout the content on Dolthub and sync to chroma
	- Finally, validate that the input chroma database has an equal response to a query as the output database - when using the out-of-date database try querying for 'DSpline' and compare the results
	- Between steps in this test require the user to validate the step (like with the VMRAGTestSimple test)
