- IssueID = PP13-47
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- Background: During validation of the DoltPushTool functionality, a critical user experience issue was discovered where the push operation reports misleading success information. The tool reports "Already up to date" with 0 commits pushed even when commits are actually successfully pushed to the remote repository.
- Current Issue: The DoltPushTool provides completely inaccurate feedback about push operations, making it impossible for users to understand what actually happened during their push.
- Root Cause Analysis has identified four specific problems:
	1. **Hard-coded Zero Commits**: Line 125 in DoltPushTool.cs contains `int commitsPushed = 0;` with a TODO comment, meaning commits_pushed is always reported as 0 regardless of actual push results
	2. **No Push Result Analysis**: The tool calls `DoltCli.PushAsync()` but doesn't analyze the actual dolt command output to determine what happened during the push operation
	3. **Misleading Success Logic**: The message logic always reports "Already up to date" because commitsPushed is always 0, even when commits were actually pushed
	4. **Incorrect Remote State**: The remote_commit field shows the local commit hash instead of the actual remote commit hash, making it appear as if local and remote were already synchronized
- Enhancement Required: Implement comprehensive push result analysis and accurate reporting in DoltPushTool.
- Specific Requirements:
	1. **Parse Dolt Push Output**: Analyze the output from `dolt push` command to determine actual push results. Common patterns include:
		- Successful push: `"To <url>\n   abc1234..def5678  main -> main"` (extract commit count from range)
		- Already up to date: `"Everything up-to-date"`
		- New branch: `"* [new branch]      main -> main"`
		- Rejected push: Various rejection messages
	2. **Calculate Actual Commits Pushed**: Replace the hard-coded 0 with actual commit count calculation based on push output analysis
	3. **Accurate Status Messages**: Provide correct status messages based on actual push results:
		- "Pushed N commits to remote/branch" when commits were pushed
		- "Already up to date" only when no commits were needed
		- Appropriate messages for new branches, rejections, etc.
	4. **Correct Remote State Reporting**: After successful push, query the actual remote commit hash instead of using local commit hash for remote_commit field
	5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Distinguish between different types of push failures (authentication, rejection, network issues, etc.) and provide specific error codes and helpful messages
- Implementation Guidelines:
	- Focus on DoltPushTool.cs and any supporting methods needed in DoltCli.cs
	- Enhance the existing DoltCli.PushAsync method to return more detailed result information if needed
	- Maintain backward compatibility with existing tool interface
	- Add comprehensive logging for debugging push result analysis
	- Follow existing code patterns and architecture principles from BasePrompt.md
- Testing Requirements: Create or enhance test cases to verify:
	- Correct reporting when actual commits are pushed
	- Correct "up to date" reporting when no commits need pushing  
	- Accurate commit count calculation for various push scenarios
	- Proper error handling for rejected pushes
	- Correct remote state reporting after successful pushes
- Expected Outcome: Users receive accurate, detailed information about push operations, enabling them to understand exactly what happened during their push and the current state of local vs remote repositories.
