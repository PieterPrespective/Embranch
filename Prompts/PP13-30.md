- IssueID = PP13-30
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- In this activity we'll be setting up the bae implementation for Dolt database integration
	- please read the document 'Documentation/tdd/Dolt_Interface_Implementation_Plan.md'
		- Note this is a long document (3055 lines) - but reading it fully is important for your context - so please read it in segments - if thats too hard, let me know so I can segment it in readable chunks
	- Please take special notice of chapter 6 section 1 - implementation for phase 1
		- Please execute all actions developement necassary to be able to test the following at the end of this activity
			- Use CLIWrap for interaction with dolt
			- Arguably - allow the user to specify the location of dolt.exe if so required - on this system dolt.exe is located at C:\Program Files\Dolt\bin
			- Validate all actions in section 3.1 via integration tests - arguably these integration tests need not use dolthub, but may work on a local temporary dolt remote
