- IssueID = PP13-62-c1
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- This activity implements the DoltMerge MCP tools based on the comprehensive design document created in PP13-62
- For context please read:
	- The merge tool design document at 'Documentation/tdd/MergeToolDesign.md' - this is the main blueprint for this implementation
	- The existing DoltCLI implementation patterns in 'Tools/DoltCommitTool.cs' and 'Tools/DoltPushTool.cs' for consistency
	- The existing merge handling in 'Services/SyncManagerV2.cs' particularly the ProcessMergeAsync method
- In this activity specifically focus on implementing the merge preview and execution tools with full conflict resolution capabilities
	- Please implement 'PreviewDoltMergeTool' following the design specifications in section 4.1 of the design document
	- Please implement 'ExecuteDoltMergeTool' following the design specifications in section 4.2 of the design document
	- Please implement 'ConflictAnalyzer' service as specified in section 4.3 of the design document
	- Please implement 'MergeConflictResolver' service as specified in section 4.4 of the design document
	- Please create the enhanced models in 'Models/MergeModels.cs' as specified in section 3 of the design document
	- Please extend IDoltCli with the new methods required for merge preview functionality
	- Please update ISyncManagerV2 to support the enhanced merge processing with resolution support
	- Please register the new services and tools in Program.cs
- The implementation should support the following key scenarios:
	- User previews a merge to see potential conflicts before executing
	- System identifies auto-resolvable conflicts (non-overlapping field changes)
	- User receives structured JSON with conflict GUIDs and detailed information
	- User provides resolution preferences using conflict GUIDs
	- System executes merge applying user resolutions and auto-resolving remainder
	- Auxiliary tables (sync_state, local_changes) are properly maintained
	- ChromaDB collections are synchronized after successful merge
- Please create comprehensive integration tests 'IntegrationTests/MergeToolIntegrationTests.cs' that validate:
	- Preview correctly identifies conflicts and generates stable GUIDs
	- Auto-resolvable conflicts are correctly identified
	- User-specified resolutions are correctly applied
	- Field-level merge combines non-conflicting changes
	- Custom resolutions apply user-provided values
	- Auxiliary tables remain consistent through merge operations
	- ChromaDB sync occurs correctly after merge completion
	- Error cases are properly handled (invalid resolution JSON, unresolved conflicts, etc.)
- Ensure all new code follows the project architecture rules:
	- Functional programming with static utility classes where appropriate
	- Comprehensive XML documentation on all public members
	- Proper use of ToolLoggingUtility for consistent logging
	- Error responses follow existing patterns with specific error codes
	- All async operations properly handled with ConfigureAwait(false) where appropriate
