- IssueID = PP13-37
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- The current application has a critical architectural flaw - its designed around uni-directional data transfer from dolt to chroma - however actual use requires bi-directional data transfer - I've already asked Opus to update the design document - but now we'll need to update the codebase to match the new design; this includes reviewing all tests previously created for (still) relevance
- For context please read:
	- The refactor plan created in PP13-36 - 'Documentation\tdd\CodeUpdatePlan_251215.md'; this is the main guideline for this assignment
	- the updated architectural plan at - 'Documentation\tdd\Dolt_Interface_Implementation_Plan_V2.md'
		- Note : this is a very long document of 4970 lines - since the document 'CodeUpdatePlan_251215.md' was developed based on this document you should only need to read the lines described per activity
	-  a summary with details on what specifically changed compared to the original plan - 'Documentation\tdd\Dolt_Plan_Changelog_2025-12-13.md'
- In this activity specifically focus on the functions required for synchronizing Dolt and Chroma databases bi-directionally, DO NOT yet pay attention on how these functions are accessed in actual mcp tool
	- Please re-implement the 'ChromaDoltSyncIntegrationTests' to match the user flow below - User A, B, and C should have seperate 'ChromaPythonService' and 'DoltCli' instances - please ignore any semantic opposites that can accrue in the databases (outside of the scope of this test)
	- The use cases:
		- User A has a local repository and records teachings in the local chroma database
		- User A commits/pushes his teachings to Dolthub via the MCP server on branch main
		- User B pulls a clone from the teachings to his local repository - his ML uses these teachings via querying the chroma database 
		- User B updates the teachings based on own learnings
		- User B commits/pushes the updated teachings to Dolthub via the MCP server on branch B
		- User C pulls a clone from the teachings to his local repository - his ML uses these teachings via querying the chroma database 
		- User C updates the teachings based on own learnings
		- User C commits/pushes the updated teachings to Dolthub via the MCP server on branch C
		- User A merges the teachings from branches main, branch B and branch C on branch D - reviews their validity using a local clone and commits/pushes the combined teachings back to a new commit on branch main
		- Users B and C pull in the latest main and their chroma database is automatically updated with the new content
