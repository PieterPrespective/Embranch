- IssueID = PP13-31
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- Please implement a credential management system for Dolthub authentication
	- Please read 'Documentation\tdd\SecureDolthubCredentialManagement.md' for reference
	- Please implement the suggested Windows Credential Manager (via `AdysTech.CredentialManager`)
	- If possible, when credentials are lacking - try to open a browser screen with an appropriate login page - so we needn't manually juggle account passwords and secrets
	- Implement a API function to 'forget' the currently activated username and password
	- Implement appropriate integration testing - however, for a real-world test a test with user input should also be implemented - exclude this test from the normal testbench; but allow it to be called manually (or with the right filter)
