- IssueID = PP13-35
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- please read the document 
- please read the logs from PP13-34 from 'chroma-feat-design-planning-mcp'
- In the last activity we've build an end-to-end/ integration test to validate that copying data from chroma to dolt and back works - however there seem to be some issues in this workflow:
	- the test 'ChromaDoltSync_EndToEndWorkflow_ShouldMaintainDataConsistency' in ChromaDoltSyncIntegrationTests.cs fails when comparing files in the input and output database
	- We identified a critical blocker: 
		  - Python.NET threading deadlock in ChromaDB collection creation
		  - Occurs specifically when creating collections after previous operations
		  - Affects multi-service ChromaDB scenarios (core to sync operations)
		  - Multiple mitigation attempts failed
  - In this assignment we want to specifically resolve these issues - at the end of this activity we specifically want to have the integration test 'ChromaDoltSync_EndToEndWorkflow_ShouldMaintainDataConsistency'  working and - if possible - also have its manual counterpart 'SyncManagerManualTest' working
  - Please start with trying to get a quick reproducable test with the python deadlock situation - we know it occurs in 'SyncManagerManualTest' at step 4, but I expect it can be reproduced when running the syncmanager in 'ChromaDoltSync_EndToEndWorkflow_ShouldMaintainDataConsistency'
