- IssueID = PP13-62
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- In this activity we want to formulate a clear, systemic and durable plan for implementing the 'DoltMerge' MCP tool - this includes the Dolt Merge Utility functions that need to be implemented on top/ integrated with the DoltCLI
	- Please read 'Documentation/tdd/251216_Dolt_Interface_Implementation_Plan_v3.md'; which is the original plan for this MCP server
		- Particularly focus on the sections focussing on merge functionalities and dolt
		- Note this is a long document (5817 lines), so please read in segments
	- Please read the document 'Examples/DoltChromaMergeConflicts.md' - it proposes a high level approach for resolving merge conflicts in Dolt via the MCP server and syncing with Chroma
	- Please read over the issue documentation in 'chroma-feat-design-planning-mcp' - and review issues that have affected the DoltCLI implementation - particularly pay attention to recurring issues with tool implementation, testing and CLI interfacing issues that may occur as a result of working with Dolt and CLIWrap
	- Please also take a deep look at the currently implemented dolt tools, their structure, their error catching and how we currently (integration) test them; most interesting tools are likely
		- DoltCloneTool
		- DoltCommitsTool
		- DoltCommitTool
		- DoltPushTool
	- Specifically deeply think about how we want to resolve merge conflicts in the MCP tool
		- The user will likely want to have most issues resolved automatically, but argue to what extend this is possible - also thinking about the auxiliary tables we use for syncing state
		- In some situations the user will want to manually chose whether to use 'Ours' or 'Their' changes for specific conflicts - as such a JSON response should be provided to the user showing an overview of conflicts, and the user/mcp client should be able to reply with a new JSON indicating his/her preferences
			- Arguably this requires the creation of 2 tools (to allow for the 'user feedback loop')
				- PreviewDoltMergeTool - this tool attempts to preview what merging 2 commits/branches would result in, if a merge conflict is expected it returns a structured JSON outlining the conflicts, the conflicting values, the suggested solution - each conflict has a GUID
				- ExecuteMergeTool - this tool actually performs the merge; it expects a JSON with the conflict GUIDS from the 'PreviewDoltMergeTools' - if it encounters conflicts no resolution is provided for by the client it simply fails (with a clear message why)
	- Output a document - 'Documentation/tdd/MergeToolDesign.md' that outlines in great detail how the tool(s) should be implemented given the results from this investigation - include clear description of the tool user endpoints, the changes required to currently implemented code, and how to deeply test both the new tools (specifically including validation of merge conflict resolution) and the changed code
