- IssueID = PP13-31
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- Please read the 'chroma-feat-design-planning-mcp' log on PP13-31; this is a continuation of that issue
	- Please read 'Documentation\tdd\SecureDolthub_userInteraction.md' for context on this assignment
	- Please implement the DMMS.AuthHelper.exe - and implement its invocation when authentication is missing
	- Please make the key at which the information is stored within the Windows Credential Manager settable by the user (via arguments?) (i.e. MCP server settings within .mcp.json when working with Claude CLI) - a single LLM may have multiple running DMMS instances, and each may have a different credential requirement
